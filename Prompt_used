### 1. Problem Scoping and High-Level Design

**Prompt:**  
> _“I’m designing a cost optimization solution for storing billing records in Azure Cosmos DB with serverless architecture. The DB size has grown to 2 million records, each up to 300KB, mostly read-heavy, and records older than 3 months are rarely accessed. The solution must be simple, have no downtime or data loss, and maintain existing API contracts. Can you summarise the key challenges and propose a high-level, cost-effective Azure-native approach?”_

**Purpose:**  
To frame the key challenges and gain an initial high-level design overview based on given constraints and workload characteristics.

### 2. Architectural Design with Constraints and Failure Modes

**Prompt:**  
> _“Please draft a detailed architecture diagram and solution that uses Azure Cosmos DB, Blob Storage, and serverless Azure Functions or Data Factory for automation. The design should allow seamless retrieval of old records (within seconds), no API changes, and zero downtime. Also, list potential failure points and mitigation strategies.”_

**Purpose:**  
To obtain a thoughtfully designed architecture including components, data flow, automation strategy, and potential failure mitigation — ensuring production readiness.

---

### 3. Implementation Guidance & Robust Code Drafting

**Prompt:**  
> _“Can you help me generate Python pseudocode for an Azure Function to archive billing records older than 3 months from Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage (JSON blob format), including safe deletion and retry logic to avoid data loss?”_

**Purpose:**  
To secure concrete, production-quality code snippets that handle data migration with safety, idempotency, and logging.

---

### 4. API Layer Fallback Logic for Seamless Reads

**Prompt:**  
> _“How do I implement an API layer read interceptor in Python that seamlessly queries Cosmos DB first, and if not found, queries the archived JSON blobs in Blob Storage, preserving original API contracts with no downtime?”_

**Purpose:**  
To maintain strict API contract compatibility while supporting fallback retrieval that enables transparent access to archived data.

---

### 5. Cost Optimization & Storage Tiering Policies

**Prompt:**  
> _“What are best practices for using Azure Blob Storage lifecycle policies to minimize costs for storing archived billing records, including tier transitions to Cool and Archive tiers, balancing retrieval latency and cost?”_

**Purpose:**  
To balance cost and performance using Azure Blob storage lifecycle management, ensuring archival data remains cost-effective without sacrificing SLA requirements.

---

### 6. Handling Failure Scenarios and Production Readiness

**Prompt:**  
> _“Identify potential failure cases in this archival system (e.g. partial migrations, high concurrency, Blob cold-tier latency) and how to handle retries, alerting, and idempotency to ensure production-grade reliability.”_

**Purpose:**  
To anticipate real-world operational challenges and design mechanisms for fault tolerance, consistency, and system monitoring.

---

### 7. Documentation and Repository Structuring

**Prompt:**  
> _“Suggest a clean GitHub repository structure and README.md outline for this solution, including architecture diagrams, scripts, monitoring recommendations, and sample commands, so it’s easy for reviewers to navigate and understand.”_

**Purpose:**  
To present the solution clearly and professionally, facilitating easy review and implementation by others.
